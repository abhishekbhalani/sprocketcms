=Quick How-To Guide for Processing Forms in Sprocket=

Because Sprocket is a significant sidestep from the traditional ASP.Net Page framework, processing of forms must be approached a little differently. Below I will give two different methods for processing form posts. _The Custom Way_ can be used if you have a deeper understanding of Sprocket and need to process things differently to normal. _The Proper Way_, though, uses a bunch of shortcuts designed to make your life easier when processing forms using Sprocket.

==Processing Forms the Proper Way==

If you haven't already, get an overview of [BasicWebsiteConstruction basic website construction].

The first thing you want to do is set up a page with a form on it and various fields. The steps to having a fully-working submittable form are generally:

  # build the form HTML
  # pre-populate the form values with either
   # default values (e.g. for a new record) or
   # pre-existing values (e.g. from an existing record)
  # handle form submission, including:
   * saving the form values if they were all valid, then redirecting to another page
   * displaying the form page again if there were errors
  # display error messages on the form if the form was submitted with any invalid field values
  # display error styles if there are form field validation errors

==Processing Forms the Custom Way==

Let's say you have the following form somewhere on a page in your website:
{{{
<form method="post" action="/submit-my-form/">
	Your name: <input type="text" name="name" />
	<input type="submit" />
</form>
}}}

You should now make a generic module (or use one you've already created). Here is a basic module template:
{{{
using Sprocket;
using Sprocket.Web;

[ModuleDependency(typeof(WebEvents))]
[ModuleTitle("My Request Handler")]
[ModuleDescription("This is a basic module for handling requests")]
public class MyRequestHandler : ISprocketModule
{
	public void AttachEventHandlers(ModuleRegistry registry)
	{
		WebEvents.Instance.OnLoadRequestedPath += new WebEvents.RequestedPathEventHandler(WebEvents_OnLoadRequestedPath);
	}

	void WebEvents_OnLoadRequestedPath(HandleFlag handled)
	{
		switch (SprocketPath.Value)
		{
			case "submit-my-form":
				ProcessYourForm();
				break;

			default:
				return;
		}
		handled.Set(); // ensure that Sprocket considers the request handled
	}
}
}}}
