admin needs to be changed to a translucent floating window that is always present
if you have admin privileges. The window normally stays collapsed in the top left
corner but can be expanded out and moved around.

<script>
var allFloatingWindows = [];
function CreateFloatingWindow() {
	var win = new FloatingWindow();
	
}
function FloatingWindow(id) {
	var html = '<div id="' + id + '">
}
</script>
