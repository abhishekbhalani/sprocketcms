	/// This class maintains state information during script execution. Often there will be a case where a script
	/// causes another script to be executed. This can happen two ways. (a) The script can pass program flow to
	/// the secondary script by calling that script's Execute method and passing this ExecutionState object so that
	/// the secondary script will continue to write to the same stream and perform correct recursion checking.
	/// (b) The script can execute the secondary script independently in order to resolve the value of an expression.
	/// When this happens, the secondary script will need to use its own internal ExecutionState object as it will be
	/// writing a new temporary stream that will be used as the expression value in the primary script. The problem
	/// involved with such a scenario is that the child script can then cause infinite recursion as it has its own
	/// ScriptNameStack, and thus entries in the primary stack won't be considered. To avoid this, when calling a
	/// secondary script in order to resolve an expression[to do]
